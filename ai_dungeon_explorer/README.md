## Description
#### AI Dungeon Explorer is a Python-based text adventure game where the player navigates a secret AI research lab to collect five AI knowledge tokens by solving puzzles in different rooms. The project is designed to demonstrate fundamental Python programming skills learned in CS50P, including functions, loops, conditionals, user input, and state management, while also being interactive and fun.The game features five rooms: North, South, East, West, and Central. Each room contains a unique puzzle that the player must solve to collect a token. In the North Room, the player solves a simple math problem. The South Room challenges the player to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 5. In the East Room, the player must choose the correct AI field from multiple options, reinforcing basic AI knowledge. The West Room contains a word puzzle where the player rearranges letters to form a meaningful phrase, promoting problem-solving skills. Finally, the Central Room presents a riddle about AI, requiring the player to think critically to complete the game.The game’s interface is clean and user-friendly, displaying the current room and the available actions at every turn. Actions include inspect, collect, quit, and help, ensuring that the player always knows what commands are possible. The inspect command allows the player to examine the room for a puzzle, while collect is used to attempt the puzzle and gain a token. The help command provides a reminder of actions and instructions. This approach demonstrates how Python can manage dynamic game states, handle user input, and respond to conditions based on player actions.AI Dungeon Explorer also highlights state management in Python through the use of dictionaries to track the player’s current location, collected tokens, and overall game progress. Functions are used to modularize code for each puzzle, keeping the project organized and easy to extend. Each puzzle is implemented in a separate function, and the main game loop controls the flow, checking the player’s progress and ending the game once all five tokens are collected or the player chooses to quit.This project is particularly relevant for an AI-focused context, such as an MBZUAI application, as it combines Python programming skills with AI-themed content. While the puzzles themselves are simple, they are educational and creative, making the game both a demonstration of coding ability and a reflection of interest in AI.Overall, AI Dungeon Explorer is a polished, fully working Python project that showcases core CS50P concepts, demonstrates interactive programming, and emphasizes problem-solving and creativity. It can easily be extended with more rooms, randomized puzzles, scoring systems, or more advanced AI concepts, making it a versatile foundation for further Python or AI projects.
